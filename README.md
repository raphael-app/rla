##### How to use ? 

Raphael backed application aims to consuming custom rest APIs from Raphael, authorized&authenticated with oAuth2, to its clients. For a simple flow, you need to obtain an access_token first, then you can just send requests to fetch datas.

You can easily fetch restaurants lists without logging/registering. But to be able to create / edit your own restaurant property, you need to login / register.
